## Process

1. Created the design for the work day scheduler web app using HTML and CSS.
2. Using Jquery , connected to the HTML document.
   - Grabbed the elements from the HTML page.
   - Created functions to save the event and display colors for the timeblock based on the past, current and future

## Using WorkDay Scheduler

To use WorkDay Scheduler, follow these steps:

1. Create an event for the particular time.
2. Save the event.

If you refresh the page, the events should stay on the page. Also, gray time blocks mean that that time is in the past, red means that is the current hour, and green means that that time is in the future.
